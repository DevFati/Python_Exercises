#Write a program that creates a Spanish-English translation dictionary. The user will enter the words in 
# Spanish and English separated by colons, and each <word>:<translation> pair separated by commas. 
# The program must create a dictionary with the words and their translations. Then you will ask for
#  a phrase in Spanish and use the dictionary to translate it word by word. If a word is not in the
#  dictionary you must leave it untranslated.
