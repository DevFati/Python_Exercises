#Bella Napoli pizzeria offers vegetarian and non-vegetarian pizzas to its customers. 
# The ingredients for each type of pizza appear below.

#Vegetarian ingredients: Pepper and tofu.
#Non-vegetarian ingredients: Pepperoni, Ham and Salmon.
#Write a program that asks the user if they want a vegetarian pizza or not, and based on their answer, 
# shows them a menu with the ingredients available for them to choose from. You can only choose
#  one ingredient besides the mozzarella and tomato that are on all pizzas. At the end it must be 
# shown on the screen whether the chosen pizza is vegetarian or not and all the ingredients it contains.
